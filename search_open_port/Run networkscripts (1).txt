HOW TO RUN SEARCH SCRIPTS ON POWERSHELL


*Save the "recon" script into your desktop for easy acess*

*Make sure you also have a file titled, "domains.txt" and put all the domains there (see attached example for NJ)



STEPS

1. Open Powershell

2. Enter: cd Desktop #Should change directory to desktop where you can access the file

3. Enter: ./recon.ps1

DONE


///Note///
This will search all the domains from your domains.txt file. You may choose to save to a txt file, but copying/pasting might be best.
You may get some test connection errors and alike, just ignore and let the script run


TROUBLESHOOTING

If powershell doesn't run the script, try the following:

1. Close powershell and then open again

2. Enter: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\(Your script file name      domain name)

OR
3. Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force     #Removes any file restrictions for the session

OR (Preferred)

4. Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force #Removes any file restrictions for the user (so don't have to redo again)


5. Change directory to where your file is ex. cd Desktop

6. Run the file: ./recon.ps1 


///Note//

If you prefer searching manually, you can do this - 

 Enter: ./recon.ps1 (name of domain you want to check) (name of other domain) (name of other domain)


*You may want to limit domains to three or four because powershell has its limits on what it can output.*

*Also, after step 5, you might have to enter: Unblock-File -Path .\recon.ps1   (if it still doesn't run.)
 


SEARCHING FOR MANY DOMAINS

1. Create a text file called "domains.txt"

2. Fill it with domains, ex - 

monmouth.edu
rutger.edu
rowan.edu
etc...

3. Save it and then run ./recon.ps1

This overcomes the limitation of powershell by running each domain one at a time as though the user were manually searching.


OPTIONAL

You can run the job without powershell open by using: Start-Job -ScriptBlock { & "C:\Users\[your username]\Desktop\recon.ps1" }

For large domain lists, you can output to a file:  - .\recon.ps1 | Out-File "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\scan_results.txt"

For lists >1000, divide in half as two separate txt files and run ./recon.ps1 output to a file.
