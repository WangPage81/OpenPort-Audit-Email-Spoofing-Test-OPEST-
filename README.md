# University Port & Email Security Assessment (UPESA)

## Project Overview
The **University Port & Email Security Assessment (UPESA)** is a cybersecurity research project focused on evaluating the security posture of U.S. university networks. This project involves identifying open network ports, assessing firewall configurations, and testing email security mechanisms for vulnerabilities.

This research is conducted under the guidance of a professor at Monmouth University and follows ethical hacking principles to improve institutional security.

## Objectives
- **Port Scanning & Analysis:**
  - Identify all active network ports in U.S. university domains.
  - Determine which ports are open and assess security risks.
  - Analyze firewall configurations and misconfigurations.

- **Email Security Testing:**
  - Test Monmouth University's email system for vulnerabilities related to spam and spoofing.
  - Identify misconfigurations in authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of spam filters and anti-phishing mechanisms.

- **Reporting & Recommendations:**
  - Document findings in a comprehensive security assessment report.
  - Provide recommendations for mitigating discovered vulnerabilities.
  - Suggest security enhancements to improve resilience against cyber threats.

## Ethical Considerations
This project strictly adheres to **ethical hacking guidelines**. All tests and scans are performed only with prior authorization from the respective institutions. The findings are intended for **educational and security improvement purposes only**.
